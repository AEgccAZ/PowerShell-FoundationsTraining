#Powershell Remoting based on WinRM

#WinRM
#runs in two modes: HTTP mode, HTTPS
#HTTP mode uses authentication username/password or kerberos
#HTTPS mode uses certificate based authentication
#Default authentication uses single sign on authentication using the current user via kerberos
#Default Endpoints requires administrative rights
#Creating custom endpoints can be a regular user
